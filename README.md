# Test task for C++ developer

## Task 1
Implement a function that takes a signed integer as input and prints its binary representation as in memory.

## Task 2
Implement a function that removes sequentially duplicate characters in a string.

## Task 3
Implement serialization and deserialization functions for a doubly linked list. Data must be written in binary format. 
The algorithmic complexity is less than quadratic. ListNode structure cannot be modified.

## Task 4
Implement sorting vector of string with big numbers with using multithreading solution.

## Task 5
Find the number of subsequences from 1 to A in the original sequence.

## Task 6
